# Agent instructions:

check PROJECT_SETUP_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md for the project design.

- We will now expand on the ticket system. It needs to have checkboxes for: Started, Coded, Tested, Reviewed
- Also we added better instruction to generate a proper agents.md file that has more explicit workflow specifications so that it serves as a good prompt for the agent.

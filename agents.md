# Agent Instructions

Review `PROJECT_SETUP_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` to understand the Project Setup Wizard design.

## Workflow

1. Manage tasks using `tickets.md`. Each ticket includes the following checkboxes to track progress:
   - [ ] Started
   - [ ] Coded
   - [ ] Tested
   - [ ] Reviewed
2. Work on one ticket at a time and update its checkboxes as you progress.
3. When a ticket is complete, open a pull request referencing it. A review ticket will be created and the reviewer may reopen the original ticket if changes are required.
4. Continue iterating through tickets until the project is finished.
